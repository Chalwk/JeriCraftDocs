# 🛠️ Scheduled Server Maintenance 🛠️

Dear JeriCraft community,

We want to inform you that our Minecraft server will undergo scheduled maintenance every **Monday** from **07:30 to 08:00 AM NZST**. This is to ensure smooth performance and data safety.

During this maintenance period, we will be backing up files and performing necessary updates or adjustments, and the server will be temporarily unavailable.

Thank you for your understanding and support!
