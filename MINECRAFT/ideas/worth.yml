# Balancing Considerations:
# - Composite items follow: Value = (Sum of ingredient raw values) × (1 + Labor Factor).
# - Processed materials (blocks, ingots, paper) use ~10% labor overhead.
# - Tools use higher overhead: for example, wooden tools ~50% overhead, iron tools ~50%,
#   diamond tools ~60%, and netherite upgrades add the cost of one netherite ingot plus ~10%.
# - Armor recipes (which normally use multiple ingots or diamonds, sometimes leather or scutes)
#   are recalculated with an approximate labor factor of ~50–60%.
#
# NOTE: Many recipes (and even the “raw” values) are approximations.
