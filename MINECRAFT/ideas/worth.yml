# Balancing Considerations:
# - Processing & Labor: Each itemâ€™s value reflects the work involved (gathering, smelting, crafting, etc.).
# - Resource Rarity: Common items (e.g., wood, stone) are priced low, whereas rarer materials and mob drops carry higher values.
# - Player Economy Dynamics: Monitor trades and adjust values if items prove too cheap or too expensive.
# - Category Consistency: Composite items are consistently priced based on their raw materials plus a labor/multiplicity factor.
