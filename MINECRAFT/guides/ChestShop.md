## 🏪 ChestShop Tutorial 🛒

Welcome to the **ChestShop Tutorial**! 🎉 With ChestShop, you can create your own shops using signs and chests, enabling easy buying and selling of items. Let's dive right in! 🏊

### **Step 1: Build Your Shop** 🏗️

Start by constructing a building or area for your shop. Be creative and make your shop stand out from the crowd! 💫

### **Step 2: Place a Chest** 📦

Position a chest in your shop area near where you'll place the sign. This chest will hold the items you want to sell.

### **Step 3: Stock Up** 📈

Fill the chest with the items you wish to sell. Organize your items so your customers can easily find what they're looking for.

### **Step 4: Create a Sign** 📋

Now it's time to create a sign for your shop. Place a sign **on or directly above** the chest and fill in the lines as follows:

- **Line 1**: Leave blank (ChestShop will automatically add your username) 👤
- **Line 2**: Item quantity (e.g., "1" for individual items or "64" for a stack) 📏
- **Line 3**: Item price (e.g., "B 10" to sell for 10 currency units or "S 5" to buy for 5 currency units) 💸
- **Line 4**: Item name (e.g., "diamond" or "wooden_shovel") 🔨

To find the material name for the item you're holding, type `/iinfo` (with two i's) in the chat.

### **Step 5: Verify Your Shop** 🧐

Once the sign is complete, ChestShop will automatically add your username to the first line. This confirms your shop is set up correctly! ✅

### **Step 6: Selling Items** 💰

When a customer wants to buy an item, they'll right-click the sign. The item will be deposited into the chest, and the customer will be charged the specified price. 💵

### **Step 7: Restocking** 🆕

Restocking is a breeze! Just refill the chest with the desired items to keep your shop well-stocked. 📦

### **Step 8: Buying Items** 💸

Customers can buy items by left-clicking the sign. The item will be removed from the chest, and the customer will be charged the specified price. 🛍️

### **Step 9: Shop Protection** 🛡️

No need to worry about your shop's security! ChestShop provides built-in protection, ensuring that only you can break the sign or chest. 🔐

That's it! You're now ready to create a fully functioning ChestShop that contributes to JeriCraft's thriving economy. Happy trading! 🥳
