# JeriCraft Community Rules

#### Information

JeriCraft server rules are designed to ensure a positive experience for all players. Staff members and volunteers are
expected to follow these rules along with normal players

#### VPN / Proxy Warning

Our server utilizes a mod to catch repeat cheaters and players who break the rules and attempt to return to our server.
Because this system is based around IP checking, it is advised that you do not make use of a freely available Proxy /
VPN or cheap VPN services. Cheaters may use these cheap or free services while on our server. If you use them, you need
to make sure you are the only one who will be connecting with that IP address (For example, your work VPN may be safe).
We will not reverse bans for appeals that are made due to being banned while on a Proxy / VPN.

### Tiered Punishment System:
To maintain a fair and enjoyable environment for all JeriCraft players, we employ a tiered punishment system. The consequences for each tier are at the discretion of the staff member issuing the punishment.

#### Tier 1: Severe Offenses - Permanent Ban

Offenses in this tier may result in a permanent ban.

- **Unfair Advantages:** Utilizing external programs, devices, exploits, bug abuse, or hacking to gain an unfair advantage in gameplay.
- **Deception and Scamming:** Engaging in deceptive actions or scams that negatively impact other players.
- **Impersonation:** Falsely representing oneself as another player, staff member, or official admin.
- **Discriminatory Behavior:** Promoting hatred or discrimination through language or actions, including hate speech on in-game chat or Discord.
- **Threats and Harassment:** Making threats or engaging in targeted harassment that disrupts the server's community and atmosphere, whether in-game, on Discord, or in direct messages.
- **Privacy Violations:** Sharing personal information without consent or attempting to obtain such information (doxxing).
- **Malicious Activities:** Distributing malware, viruses, or compromising server security, or causing disruptions on the Discord server.

#### Tier 2: Moderate Offenses - 1 to 2-week Ban

Offenses in this tier may result in a ban of 1 to 2 weeks, depending on severity.

- **Property Damage and Vandalism:** Altering or destroying others' builds without permission (griefing), or creating offensive structures or signs.
- **Inappropriate Content:** Sharing or displaying content containing nudity, gore, or offensive material, including inappropriate skins or posting such content on Discord.
- **Abusive Communication:** Using disrespectful language, inappropriate voice chat, or abusive slang that targets specific players or the general community in-game or on Discord.
- **Harassment and Disruptive Conduct:** Engaging in actions that disturb other players or the server's atmosphere, such as trolling, spamming, ignoring staff instructions, or being excessively argumentative on Discord.
- **Account Infractions:** Sharing accounts, boosting, or using multiple accounts to evade bans or sanctions.
- **Exploiting Bugs and Glitches:** Taking advantage of in-game glitches or bugs for unfair gains or disrupting gameplay, or exploiting Discord server vulnerabilities.

#### Tier 3: Minor Offenses - Up to 1-week Ban

Offenses in this tier may result in a ban of up to 1 week, at the staff's discretion.

- **Unwanted Communication:** Sending unsolicited content or repeatedly posting irrelevant messages that disrupt chat, such as false reports or commercial spam in-game or on Discord.
- **Inappropriate Roleplay:** Participating in roleplay scenarios that include offensive or inappropriate themes.
- **Misuse of Slang:** Employing abusive slang in non-targeted ways that could offend others on the server or Discord.
- **Inappropriate Conversations:** Discussing content or themes that are deemed inappropriate or unsuitable for the server's community on any platform.

---

#### Subsequent Offenses
Repeated rule violations will result in escalating consequences as part of a tiered punishment system. If you have been penalized for an offense and continue to engage in similar behavior after the ban expires, you will face a more severe punishment within the respective tier.

For instance, if you receive a one-week ban for non-commercial spamming and continue the behavior after the ban expires, your next ban will fall under the second-tier class of punishments. Additionally, if you are banned for one week for non-commercial spamming and are found guilty of griefing after your ban expires, you will receive a permanent ban because your Tier 2 punishment will be escalated to Tier 1.

#### Undocumented Offenses
While this list is intended to provide clear guidelines, it is not feasible to document every possible infraction. Consequently, players may still be penalized for an unlisted offense. Punishments for undocumented offenses will be at the discretion of the staff member enforcing the rules, and they will consider factors such as severity and intent.

To maintain a positive community experience, it is essential to exercise common sense and maintain a respectful attitude in all interactions within the server and on Discord.
