# JeriCraft Community Rules

### Information
JeriCraft server rules are designed to ensure a positive experience for all players. All players, including staff and volunteers, are expected to adhere to these rules.

### VPN / Proxy Warning
Our server utilizes a mod to catch repeat cheaters and players who break the rules and attempt to return. Because this system is based on IP checking, avoid using free or cheap VPN/proxy services. If you must use a VPN, ensure that you are the only one connecting through that IP address (e.g., your work VPN may be safe). We will not reverse bans for appeals made due to being banned while using a proxy or VPN.
