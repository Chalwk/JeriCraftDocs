# JeriCraft Community Rules

#### Information

JeriCraft server rules are designed to ensure a positive experience for all players. Staff members and volunteers are
expected to follow these rules along with normal players

#### VPN / Proxy Warning

Our server utilizes a mod to catch repeat cheaters and players who break the rules and attempt to return to our server.
Because this system is based around IP checking, it is advised that you do not make use of a freely available Proxy /
VPN or cheap VPN services. Cheaters may use these cheap or free services while on our server. If you use them, you need
to make sure you are the only one who will be connecting with that IP address (For example, your work VPN may be safe).
We will not reverse bans for appeals that are made due to being banned while on a Proxy / VPN.

### Tiered Punishment System
To maintain a fair and enjoyable environment for all JeriCraft players, we employ a tiered punishment system. The consequences for each tier are at the discretion of the staff member issuing the punishment.

#### Tier 1: Serious Offenses - Permanent Ban
Offenses in this tier are the most severe and may result in a permanent ban.

1. **Cheating**: Using external programs or devices to gain an unfair advantage, including exploiting game mechanics for duplication.
2. **Scamming**: Using deception to trick players or failing to follow through on obligations.
3. **Impersonating Staff**: Pretending to be an official admin or staff member.

#### Tier 2: Moderate Offenses - 1 to 2-week Ban
Offenses in this tier may result in a ban of 1 to 2 weeks, depending on severity.
- **Inappropriate Content**: Sharing imagery or text that includes nudity, gore, or offensive content.
- **Abusive Language**: Directing abusive or disrespectful language towards other players.
- **Commercial Spam**: Repeatedly advertising external links or unsolicited content.

#### Tier 3: Minor Offenses - Up to 1-week Ban
Offenses in this tier may result in a ban of up to 1 week, at the staff's discretion.

- **Misuse of Slang**: Using abusive language in a non-directed manner that may still offend others.
- **Report Abuse**: Purposefully submitting false reports or misusing the report system.
- **Harassment**: Directing harassing comments or actions towards other players.
- **Insubordination**: Failing to follow staff warnings or directions.

### Subsequent Offenses
In the event of repeated rule violations, a tiered punishment system will be applied. The severity of consequences will increase for each subsequent offense. For instance, if you receive a one-week ban for non-commercial spamming and continue the behavior after the ban expires, your next ban will fall under the second-tier class of punishments. Similarly, if you are banned for one week for non-commercial spamming and are found guilty of griefing after your ban expires, you will receive a permanent ban because your **Tier 2** punishment will be escalated to **Tier 1**.

### Undocumented Offenses
It is not feasible to document every possible infraction within this list. As a result, it is possible to be penalized for an unlisted offense. Punishments for undocumented offenses will be at the discretion of the staff member enforcing the rules. Exercise common sense and maintain a respectful attitude to ensure a pleasant experience for all community members.
