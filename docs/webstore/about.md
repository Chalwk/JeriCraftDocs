# JeriCraft Web Store

Welcome to the JeriCraft Web Store, where we offer a unique approach to community perks. Instead of traditional donation packages, we provide individual perks that can be obtained separately. Your donation rank is determined by the total amount you've donated since your first contribution. Every donation helps us keep the server running, and we are grateful for your support.

Please browse the various benefits we offer our donors for their kind contributions.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, our official web-based store is currently unavailable. In the interim, we will be using GitHub to advertise our available perks.

Please note that perks are applied manually by a staff member, so if you don't receive access to your perk in-game immediately, this is why.

**We currently accept donations through PayPal only.**

If you need assistance with sending money through PayPal, please refer to [this page](https://www.paypal.com/hk/cshelp/article/how-do-i-send-payments-help293).

**DONATIONS MUST BE MADE TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS:**<br>
