## **Getting Started with JeriCraft** üåç

Welcome to **JeriCraft**, a medieval world full of adventure, strategy, and community! To help you get settled, here‚Äôs a
guide on how to get started.

### **1. Choose Your Faction** ‚öîÔ∏è

When you first join, you'll want to join a **Faction**. Factions allow you to claim land, protect your assets, and work
together with others to dominate or defend the realm. Whether you seek to build a peaceful kingdom or lead an army into
battle, the choice is yours! To join a faction, simply ask around, or use the `/f create` command to create your own.
You can also use `/f join <faction name>` to join an existing one (if it's open).

### **2. Get Your Kits** üéÅ

New players can claim free starting kits to help get them settled in the world. Use `/kit` to see what kits are
available, and `/kit <name>` to redeem one. The kits contain essential tools and resources like armor, food, and
weapons, making your survival in the wild much easier!

### **3. Start Your Jobs and Skills** üíº

JeriCraft offers a wide variety of RPG-style **jobs** and **skills** that let you specialize in different areas like
mining, fishing, farming, or even combat. Use `/jobs` to view the available options and start your journey in the
profession of your choice. You can also level up your skills using the mcMMO plugin with `/mcmmo` to unlock special
abilities and become more powerful!

### **4. Protect Your Land** üè∞

Use the [Factions Guide](/docs/guides/Factions.md) to learn how to protect your land and establish your base. In
JeriCraft, you can claim territory, build fortresses, and make sure no one can destroy what you've worked hard to build!

### **5. Explore the World** üåé

JeriCraft's world is vast and full of resources, treasures, and dangers! To get started exploring, use `/rt` to teleport
to a random location in the wild or `/warp` to access key locations around the world. Don't forget to stock up on
supplies before you venture far into the unknown!

## **Additional Tips for New Players** ‚ú®

  your armor and weapons ready, and be cautious when venturing out at night!

- **Trade and Economy** üí∞  
  The economy in JeriCraft is player-driven, so make sure to visit the marketplace and trade with other players. You can
  sell items at chest shops, bid in auctions, or accept Job quests to earn money and build your wealth!
