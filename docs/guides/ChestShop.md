# 🏪 ChestShop Tutorial 🛒

Welcome to the **ChestShop Tutorial**! 🎉 With ChestShop, you can create your own shops using signs and chests, making it easy to buy and sell items. Follow this step-by-step guide to set up your shop efficiently.

---

## Step 1: Build Your Shop 🏗️

Begin by constructing a designated area for your shop. Be creative as you can, an appealing shop design can attract more customers!

---

## Step 2: Place a Chest 📦

Position a chest in your shop area where you want to store the items for sale. Ensure it’s easily accessible for customers.

---

## Step 3: Stock the Chest 📈

Fill the chest with the items you wish to sell. Organizing your stock efficiently will make it easier for customers to find what they need.

---

## Step 4: Create a Sign 📋

Now, it's time to set up a sign for your shop. Place a sign **on or directly above** the chest and format it as follows:


```none
[Leave Blank]  <-- ChestShop will auto-fill your username
[Quantity]     <-- Number of items sold per transaction
[Price]        <-- Use 'B' for selling and 'S' for buying
[Item Name]    <-- Example: "Diamond" or "Wooden_Shovel"
```

**Example Sign Setup:**
```none
   [Your Name]   
   64            
   B 100         
   Diamond 
```

💡 To find the correct item name, type `/iinfo` in chat.

---

## Step 5: Verify Your Shop 🧐

Once the sign is placed correctly, ChestShop will automatically add your username to the first line, confirming that your shop is active.

---

## Step 6: How Customers *Buy* or *Sell* Items 💰

Customers can **right-click** the sign to purchase an item. The item will be withdrawn from the chest, and the payment will be transferred to your account.

If your shop is set up to **buy** items from **other players**, they can **left-click** the sign to sell items to you. The item will be placed in the chest, and the player will receive payment from your balance.

---

## Step 7: Restocking Your Shop 🔄

To restock, simply place more items into the chest. Keeping your inventory full ensures uninterrupted sales.

---

## Step 8: Shop Protection 🛡️

Your shop is automatically protected! Only you can modify or break the chest and sign, ensuring the security of your inventory.

---

## Step 9: WorldGuard Protected Regions 🛠️

If your shop is located in a **WorldGuard protected region**, you need to enable the `allow-shop` flag for your shop to function correctly.
Use the following command: `/rg flag <region id> allow-shop allow`
