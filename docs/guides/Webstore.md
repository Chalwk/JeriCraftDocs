# JeriCraft Web Store

Unlike many other communities, we do not offer donation packages, but instead, all perks are obtainable individually.

Your donation rank is determined by the total amount of money that you have spent (since your first purchase). Every
donation helps us keep the bills paid and the server running. We offer a range of benefits to those who do assist us
with donations from their hard-earned cash.

Please see below the various benefits we offer our donors for the kind contribution.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, our official web-based webstore had to be shutdown. In the meantime, we will be using
Discord as a means to advertise our available perks. It's a little archaic and rather a nuisance to deal with, but it's
all we have right now.

NOTE: Due to the aforementioned, perks are applied manually by a staff member, so if you don't get access to your perk
in-game straight away, this is why.

**Donations are currently only accepted through PayPal.**

If you're unsure how to send money through PayPal, please refer
to [this page](https://www.paypal.com/hk/cshelp/article/how-do-i-send-payments-help293).
