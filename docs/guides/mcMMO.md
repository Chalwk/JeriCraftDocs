   a short period. This is particularly useful when you want to maximize resource gathering efficiency in mining
   expeditions. The effect also increases the likelihood of gathering rare ores such as diamonds and emeralds during
   use.

   want to quickly gather wood for construction or crafting projects.

3. **Counterattack (Swords)**  
   Counterattack is unlocked at level 100 in Swords. It gives you the chance to parry incoming damage with your sword
   and return a portion of that damage to the attacker. This ability can turn the tide in PvP battles, as you can use it
   to deal significant damage to enemies who rely on physical attacks.

4. **Quake (Excavation)**  
   At level 150 in Excavation, the Quake ability allows you to break a large area of blocks around you when digging.
   This is perfect for players who need to clear large spaces quickly, such as when digging for resources or building
   underground structures.

   same time.

8. **Berserk (Axes)**  
   Berserk is unlocked at level 100 in Axes and temporarily increases the damage of your axe attacks. This ability is
   great for high-damage output, especially when fighting bosses or enemies with large amounts of health. Activating
