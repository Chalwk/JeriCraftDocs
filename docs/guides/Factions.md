### **Base Cost to Claim Land**

Each chunk of land requires **power** to maintain, and your **faction‚Äôs total power** determines how much land can be
claimed.

- **Faction Power** = Sum of all members' power.
- **Death Reduces Power** ‚Üí Losing power limits land claims.
- **Recruit More Members** ‚Üí Strengthen your kingdom and expand!

#### **Claim Cost Scaling**

| Claim # | Cost Formula        |      Cost |
|---------|---------------------|----------:|
| 1st     | Base Cost           |        30 |
| 2nd     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        45 |
| 3rd     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        60 |
| 4th     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        75 |
| 5th     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        90 |
| 6th     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |       105 |
| ...     | ...                 |       ... |
| etc.    | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 | Continues |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost increases by 50% per additional claim!**
The cost to claim land increases with each additional claim. Each new claim costs **50%** the previous claim's cost.
This multiplier makes it progressively more expensive to expand your faction's territory.

---

## ‚ö° Power System

> Power determines how much land your faction can **claim** and **defend**.

- **Max Faction Power:** `1000` (limits the total power a faction can have)
- **Max Power per Player:** `250` (limits the maximum power a single player can have)
- **Starting Power:** `5` (determines the initial power each player starts with)
- **Power Loss Per Death:** `3.5` (how much power a player loses when they die)
- **Offline Power Loss:** `-0.4 per day` (how much power is lost while a player is offline each day)
- **Power Regeneration Rate:** `0.2 per minute` (how quickly power regenerates over time)
- **Power Freeze Duration:** `45 seconds` (how long power gain is frozen after death)

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Raiding & Warfare

> If your faction‚Äôs **claimed land exceeds its power**, **your land becomes vulnerable to raids**!

- **Raidability:** ‚úÖ *Enabled* (Allows factions to be raided)
- **Raid Triggers:** If a faction‚Äôs land is **greater than or equal to** their power.
- **WarZone & Wilderness Power Loss:** ‚úÖ *Enabled* (You lose power when dying in warzones and wilderness.)
