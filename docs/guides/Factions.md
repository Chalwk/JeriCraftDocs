### 🏠 Base Cost to Claim Land

Each chunk of land requires **[power](#-power-system)** to maintain, and your **faction’s total power** determines how
much land can be claimed.

The base cost to claim land is **$30**, and each additional claim increases the cost by **a fixed $15** from the
previous claim. This results in a steady linear increase as your faction expands.

#### Claim Cost Scaling

| Claim # | Cost Formula             | Cost |
|---------|--------------------------|-----:|
| 1st     | Base Cost                |  $30 |
| 2nd     | Previous Cost + $15      |  $45 |
| 3rd     | Previous Cost + $15      |  $60 |
| 4th     | Previous Cost + $15      |  $75 |
| 5th     | Previous Cost + $15      |  $90 |
| 6th     | Previous Cost + $15      | $105 |
| ...     | `Base Cost + 15 × (n-1)` |  ... |

This linear scaling ensures that larger factions must carefully manage their resources while expanding their territory.
