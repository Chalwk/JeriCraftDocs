## üìú Kingdom Management

> The foundation of any great empire begins with its creation. Establish your own faction, forge alliances, and carve
> your legacy into the lands of JeriCraft. A faction serves as your **kingdom**, a gathering of warriors, builders, and
> rulers under one banner.

| **Action**                  | **Command**                 | **Description**                                                              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Rename your faction**     | `/f tag <name>`             | Change your kingdom‚Äôs official banner (name).                                |
| **View faction details**    | `/f show`                   | Display a full overview of your kingdom, including members, power, and land. |
| **Inspect another faction** | `/f who <name>`             | Gather intelligence on another faction, including its members and power.     |
| **List all factions**       | `/f list`                   | Discover all known kingdoms that roam these lands.                           |
| **Disband your faction**    | `/f disband`                | Dissolve your kingdom, scattering its people and relinquishing its lands.    |
| **Home Management**         | `/f sethome/delhome <name>` | Set or remove your home location (a safe haven for your kingdom).            |

> Once created, you become the **leader** of your faction, wielding the power to **expand your domain**,
> **recruit allies**, and **command your kingdom‚Äôs fate**. You can **manage your faction‚Äôs land, power, and members** to
> build an empire that stands the test of time.

## üìå Claiming Land

> A kingdom is nothing without its territory! Factions must **claim land** to establish castles, villages, and
> fortifications.

| **Action**           | **Command**      | **Description**                                                    |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Claim land**       | `/f claim`       | Seize control of a chunk of land for your kingdom.                 |
| **Unclaim land**     | `/f unclaim`     | Relinquish a previously claimed territory.                         |
| **Unclaim all land** | `/f unclaimall`  | Release all faction-owned land at once.                            |

| **Fill unclaim**     | `/f fillunclaim` | Automatically unclaim up to `25` chunks within a `5`-chunk radius. |

> Each chunk of land requires **power** to maintain, and you can only claim as much land as your
**faction‚Äôs total power allows**.

- Your **faction‚Äôs power** is determined by the number of members and their individual power levels.
- If a member dies, their power decreases, reducing your faction‚Äôs ability to claim land.
- Keep your kingdom strong by **recruiting more members** and **avoiding unnecessary deaths** in battle!

## ü§ù Faction Relations and Limits

> Factions can form different types of relationships with other factions, such as alliances,
> truces, or enmity. However, there are limits to how many of each type of relationship a faction can have.

### Types of Relations

- **Ally:** A friendly relationship. Allies can help each other in battles and share resources.
- **Enemy:** A hostile relationship. Enemies can attack and raid each other.
- **Neutral:** A default relationship. Neutral factions are neither friendly nor hostile.
- **Truce:** A temporary peace agreement. Truces prevent PvP between factions.

### Limits on Relations

- **Maximum Allies:** `5`
    - Your faction can form alliances with up to 5 other factions.
- **Maximum Enemies:** `10`
    - Your faction can declare up to 10 other factions as enemies.
- **Maximum Truces:** `5`
    - Your faction can have up to 5 truces with other factions.
- **Neutral Relations:** Unlimited
    - There is no limit to the number of factions your faction can remain neutral with.

### Default Relation

- The default relationship between factions is **Neutral**.
    - This ensures that factions can always revert to a neutral stance if needed.

### Important:

- **Strategic Alliances:** Form alliances with strong factions to protect your territory and gain support in battles.
- **Manage Enemies:** Be cautious when declaring enemies, as you can only have up to 10 at a time.
- **Truces for Peace:** Use truces to temporarily avoid conflict with other factions while focusing on other goals.
- **Neutral Stance:** Staying neutral with most factions can help you avoid unnecessary conflicts and focus on building
  your power.
