### **Base Cost to Claim Land**

Each chunk of land requires **power** to maintain, and your **faction‚Äôs total power** determines how much land can be
claimed.

- **Faction Power** = Sum of all members' power.
- **Death Reduces Power** ‚Üí Losing power limits land claims.
- **Recruit More Members** ‚Üí Strengthen your kingdom and expand!

#### **Claim Cost Scaling**

| Claim # | Cost Formula        |      Cost |
|---------|---------------------|----------:|
| 1st     | Base Cost           |        30 |
| 2nd     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        45 |
| 3rd     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        60 |
| 4th     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        75 |
| 5th     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |        90 |
| 6th     | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 |       105 |
| ...     | ...                 |       ... |
| etc.    | Previous Cost √ó 0.5 | Continues |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost increases by 50% per additional claim!**
The cost to claim land increases with each additional claim. Each new claim costs **50%** the previous claim's cost.
This multiplier makes it progressively more expensive to expand your faction's territory.
