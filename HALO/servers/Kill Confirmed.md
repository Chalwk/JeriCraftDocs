# Kill Confirmed - Game Mode

## üìù Overview

**Kill Confirmed** is a fast-paced, objective-based game mode inspired by *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3*. In this mode, teams score by collecting dog tags (also called skulls) dropped by enemies upon death. The first team to reach **65 points** wins, or the team with the most points when time runs out. Dog tags (skulls) will despawn after **30 seconds** by default, but this can be configured. No points are deducted for suicides, allowing players to focus on confirming kills without penalty.

### Key Features:
- **Score Limit:** First team to **65** points wins.
- **Points on Confirm:** **2 points** per dog tag collected.
- **Despawn Time:** Dog tags despawn after **30 seconds**, but the time can be configured.
- **Friendly Fire Blocked:** Friendly fire is disabled, so teammates can‚Äôt steal each other's dog tags.
- **Suicide Penalty:** No points are deducted for suicides.
- **Team Slayer:** This script is designed to run on *Team Slayer*.
