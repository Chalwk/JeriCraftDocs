# Snipers Dream Team Mod (SDTM)

## üìù Overview

**Snipers Dream Team Mod (SDTM)** is a throwback to the good old days, originally created by Skelito circa 2006-2009. This version recreates the core elements of the classic mod, with explosive snipers, unique game mechanics, and powerful weapons. It's designed for Capture the Flag (CTF) game types but can be used on any mode.

Originally, SDTM was a series of modded maps with custom skins, visual enhancements, and custom portals. This modern version allows players to enjoy the gameplay without needing the original modded maps or skins, keeping the classic thrill intact.
