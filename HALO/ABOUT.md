# JeriCraft Server Scripts

All **JeriCraft** servers are equipped with several custom scripts designed to improve gameplay, ensure fair play, and
enhance the overall server experience. Here‚Äôs a list of the scripts running on all of our servers:

## üõ†Ô∏è **Alias System**

The Alias System is an advanced tool designed to enhance security and fairness across all JeriCraft Halo servers. It
keeps a record of every player name used during gameplay, linking each alias to both the player's unique CD Key (hash)
and IP Address. This system helps catch cheaters, prevent repeat offenders from evading bans, and ensures the integrity
of the game environment by identifying players who may try to hide their identity through name changes or IP address
manipulation. With this robust tracking mechanism, we are able to maintain a clean and enjoyable community for all
players.

## üîí **VPN Blocker**

We use a **VPN Blocker** to prevent players from connecting to our servers using a VPN. This helps to reduce malicious
activity and ensures that only legitimate players can join the community.

## üìù **Server Logger**

Our **Server Logger** tracks important events and activities on the server to help maintain a secure and transparent
environment. The following events are logged:

- **SCRIPT LOAD**: When the Advanced Logger is loaded.
- **SCRIPT RELOAD**: When the Advanced Logger is re-loaded.
- **SCRIPT UNLOAD**: When the Advanced Logger is unloaded.
- **START**: A new game has started, showing the map and mode.
- **END**: When a game ends and the post-game carnage report is shown.
- **JOIN**: A player joins, including their name, ID, IP, and piracy status (whether they are using a pirated copy of
  the game).
- **QUIT**: A player quits, including their name, ID, IP, and piracy status (whether they are using a pirated copy of
  the game).
- **SPAWN**: A player spawns in the game.
- **WARP**: A player is detected warping.
- **LOGIN**: A player logs in, with their admin level.
- **RESET**: The map is reset.
- **SWITCH**: A player switches teams.
- **COMMAND**: A player executes an admin command, including their level and command type.
- **MESSAGE**: A player sends a message in chat, including message type.
- **DEATH**: Tracks various types of player deaths, including suicides, betrayals, and kills by other players.
- **FIRST BLOOD**: Tracks the first kill in a game.

And more!

## üí§ **AFK Manager**

The **AFK Manager** is designed to monitor players who are inactive for extended periods. Players detected as AFK will
be automatically warned then kicked to prevent them from affecting the gameplay experience of others.

## üö´ **Anti Cheat**

Our **Anti Cheat** script actively scans for and prevents players from using aim bots, wall hacks, camping, and other
cheating
methods (including common exploits), which would otherwise give them an unfair advantage in combat. This helps to ensure
a level playing field for all players.

## üí¨ **Admin Chat**

Admins have access to a special **Admin Chat** feature that allows them to communicate privately with other staff
members.

## üö´ **Word Buster**

The **Word Buster** script filters out inappropriate language and offensive words from chat messages to maintain a
clean and respectful environment for all players.

## üïµÔ∏è **Command Spy**

Admins can see all commands executed by players using the **Command Spy** feature, allowing them to monitor players and
ensure fair play.

## üìú Script Manager**

Runs all of our custom scripts and ensures they function correctly to provide a smooth and enjoyable gameplay
experience.

These scripts work together to provide an environment where players can enjoy fair, secure, and exciting gameplay. We
are always working to improve the community experience, so be sure to check out these features in action on all of our
