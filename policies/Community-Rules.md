# 🛡️ JeriCraft Community Rules 🎮

Welcome to the **JeriCraft Community Rules**! These guidelines are designed to ensure a **positive, fair, and enjoyable
experience** for all players **across our Minecraft, Halo, and Discord platforms**. By joining our servers **or Discord
**, you agree to abide by these rules. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, including bans.

---

## ℹ️ Information

Our rules apply to **all players and Discord members**, including staff and volunteers. They are enforced to maintain a
welcoming and respectful environment **on all platforms**. Please read them carefully and reach out to staff if you have
questions.

## 🚫 VPN / Proxy Warning 🌐

To prevent repeat offenders from bypassing bans, **our Minecraft and Halo servers** use an **IP-based detection system
**. If you use a VPN or proxy, ensure it is secure and not shared with others (e.g., a work VPN may be safe). **Free or
cheap VPNs are not recommended**, as they may result in unintended bans. **We will not reverse bans caused by VPN/proxy
usage.**

**Note for Discord:** While Discord bans are account-based, attempts to evade bans using alternate accounts or shared
VPNs will result in escalated penalties.
