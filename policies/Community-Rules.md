# üõ°Ô∏è JeriCraft Community Rules üéÆ

Welcome to the **JeriCraft Community Rules**! These guidelines are designed to ensure a **positive, fair, and enjoyable
experience** for all players. By joining our servers, you agree to abide by these rules. Failure to comply may result in
disciplinary action, including bans.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information

Our rules apply to **all players**, including staff and volunteers. They are enforced to maintain a welcoming and
respectful environment for everyone. Please read them carefully and reach out to staff if you have any questions.

## üö´ VPN / Proxy Warning üåê

To prevent repeat offenders from bypassing bans, our server uses an **IP-based detection system**. If you use a VPN or
proxy, ensure it is secure and not shared with others (e.g., a work VPN may be safe). **Free or cheap VPNs are not
recommended**, as they may result in unintended bans. If you believe your ban is accidental (e.g., shared IP), contact
staff for review. However, bans tied to VPNs are rarely overturned.

| **Use Appropriate Discord Channels**             | Keep conversations relevant to channel purposes (e.g., no off-topic discussions in `#introductions`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Discord Voice Chat Etiquette**                 | Avoid loud noises, background music, or mic spam in voice channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Respect @mentions**                            | Do not abuse @everyone, @here, or staff roles without permission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **No Griefing in Protected Regions**             | Griefing (destroying or altering builds and resources) is not possible in protected regions, as they are safeguarded from such actions. Only members of the region have the ability to modify builds, and they cannot grief without the owner's permission (or an authorized individual's). If you come across a base outside of protected regions, it is considered open to raiding or destruction. Players are responsible for protecting their own builds. |
| **No Duplication Exploits or Cheats**            | Do not use duplication glitches, cheats, or third-party programs to gain unfair advantages in-game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **No AFK Farming or Abuse of Automated Systems** | Do not use AFK (away-from-keyboard) farming techniques or automation tools (e.g., bots) to gain resources or rewards while not actively playing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Respect Build and Land Claims**                | Do not build or alter structures on land that other players have claimed, unless permitted. Respect others' builds and territory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **No Alt Accounts for Evading Punishments**      | Using alternate accounts to bypass server punishments is strictly prohibited. All accounts associated with the offending player will be penalized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Keep Player-to-Player Trades Fair**            | Do not coerce or manipulate players into unfair trades. All trades must be mutually agreed upon and conducted fairly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Respect for Server Events and Competitions**   | Do not disrupt or cheat during server-hosted events, competitions, or tournaments. Respect the integrity of these activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Respect for Staff and Volunteers**             | Staff and volunteers are here to help the community. Treat them with respect, and do not argue with their decisions in public chat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
